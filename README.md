![](https://www.boldbi.com/resources/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/sales-dashboard-featured-v1.webp)

## 📝 Task Overview 

- This project uses SQL queries to analyze sales data from the Chinook Database (a sample database containing music store transactions). The objective is to answer key business questions, uncover sales trends, and practice SQL techniques such as JOINs, aggregations, and window functions.

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: Chinook Database – Kaggle or official sample DB.

- Contains relational tables for:

    - Customers.

    - Invoices & Invoice Lines.

    - Products (tracks, albums).

    - Employees.

    - Geographic data (country, city).

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Query relational tables to answer:

  - Top-selling products (by quantity or revenue).

  - Revenue per region.

  - Monthly sales performance.

- Write JOINs to merge product, sales, and customer data.

- Use aggregations to summarize metrics.



---

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques Used
- SQL (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, or BigQuery).

- Python (optional, using libraries such as sqlite3 or SQLAlchemy for query execution and Pandas for analysis).

---

## 📊 Key Queries

- Top Products: Find the most sold products by revenue and quantity

- Regional Revenue: Group sales by country or city

- Monthly Trends: Aggregate monthly sales totals

- Customer Ranking: Use a window function to rank customers by total spend

---

## 📈 Bonus Features

- Implement at least one window function (e.g., ROW_NUMBER, RANK, or DENSE_RANK) to rank results.

---

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated

- Writing complex SQL queries.

- Performing multi-table JOIN operations.

- Applying aggregate functions (SUM, COUNT, AVG).

- Using window functions for ranking and advanced analytics.

- Translating business requirements into database queries.
